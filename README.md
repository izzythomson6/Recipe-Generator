### **#Python Recipe Generator**
This is a python project I created whilst completing the Code First Girls Introduction to Python & Apps course.
It uses the Edamam API to suggest recipes for users based on their input ingredients.

### **#Features**
Asks the user to input their name and course they are completing.
Asks the user if they can think of an ingredient and if they can't the random function will generate an ingredient from a list
Uses the Edamam API to generate a recipe from the list and then uses a for loop
Uses a while loop to continue if the user wants to and end the recipe launcher if they don't wish to generate another recipe

### **#Technologies used**

Edamam Recipe Search API

### **#What I learned**
